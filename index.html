<h2><strong>About <abbr title="Little Tacos Shop">LTS</strong></abbr></h2>
<p>
    The taco as we know it today is a blend of ancient Mexican recipes and International influences. However, before it was known in America, natives in Mexico were eating a version that looked quite different.

    Where did America‚Äôs favorite comfort food originate? Here‚Äôs the history of one of the best foods on the planet.
    
    Tacos are thought to come from Mexico, long before the Spanish arrived. Ancient Mexicans used freshly made, soft, flat corn tortillas and gave them with fillings like fish and cooked organs. It was a staple meal that provided vital nutrients and energy to those who consumed it.
    
    These tacos didn‚Äôt contain the cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and tomato that we associate with the meal today. In fact, the taco as we know it is less than 100 years old.
</p>
<h2><b>The Name ‚ÄúTaco‚Äù: A Modern Invention</b></h2>
<p>
    The word "taco" is quite new.

    It originated from Mexican silver miners in the 18 th century. Gunpowder was wrapped in a paper like a ‚Äútaquito‚Äù and inserted into rocks before detonation.
    
    By this time, tacos were known as the food of the working class, which included miners. This resulted in their portable street food being called ‚Äútacos de minero‚Äú, also known as ‚Äúminer‚Äôs tacos‚Äù.
    
    The tortilla in these miner‚Äôs tacos wasn‚Äôt a hard U-shaped shell like we know today. Instead, it was a corn tortilla with a spicy filling. This daily staple was filling, delicious, and affordable.
</p>
<h2><b>Coming to America</b></h2>
<p>
    The Taco was first introduced to the United States in 1905. Mexican migrants were coming in to work on railroads and other jobs and started to bring their delicious food with them.

    Tacos were essentially a street food at this time since they were highly portable and cheap. In fact, Americans first became exposed to tacos through Mexican food carts in Los Angeles that were run by women called ‚Äúchili queens‚Äù.
    
    These ladies sold delicious economic Mexican food like soft corn tortilla tacos, and they were deemed exotic by any American that tried one. The fillings were incredibly spicy and unfamiliar to the American palate.
</p>
<h2><b>The Change</b></h2>
<p>
    By 1920, the food Mexican immigrants brought in started to fuse with American ingredients.

    Organs were replaced with the more palatable ground beef and chicken. Cheddar cheese, cool lettuce, tomato became standard fillings. This became known as the ultimate taco to Americans whose traditional cuisine favored more subtle flavors.
    
    In short, the taco was becoming something of a Mexican-American fusion. Things got even more interesting when Taco Bell became mainstream and created a breed of ‚ÄúMexican‚Äù food that wasn‚Äôt authentically Mexican at all.
</p>
<h2><b>Tacos Today</b></h2>
<p>
    Nowadays, you can find tacos practically everywhere, from your local street food stand to Chipotle. Each place has a different experience to offer, whether it‚Äôs authentic or a Mexican-inspired fusion meal.

    Lately, due to a Millennial preference for ‚Äúmom and pop‚Äù restaurants, Taquerias are starting to become more popular. These restaurants offer authentic Mexican food like Tacos al Pastor, de Barbacoa, and Carnitas.
    
    Mexican restaurants are turning away from Americanizing their ingredients and are now bringing the real taste of Mexico‚Äîand Americans are falling in love.
    
    These tacos are different from the ones Americans preferred in the 20th century. There‚Äôs no cheese or lettuce. Instead, you‚Äôll see soft corn tortillas filled with authentically flavored meat, cilantro, radish slices, grilled onion, and an assortment of hot sauces.
